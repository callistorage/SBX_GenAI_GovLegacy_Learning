# Progressive Learning Sandbox: AI Tools for Government Legacy Systems

## Overview

This comprehensive, open-source learning sandbox teaches developers how to effectively use Generative AI coding assistant tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) within government legacy system environments. 

**Why This Matters**: While abundant content exists for modern greenfield development, there's virtually no educational material focused on the unique challenges and constraints of government legacy systems.

**What This Is NOT**: This is not a tutorial on how to use AI coding assistants. This resource assumes you have basic familiarity with AI tools and focuses specifically on applying them to legacy government systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- **Basic AI tool experience**: Familiarity with at least one AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- **Programming background**: Comfortable reading code in at least one language
- **Professional development experience**: Understanding of software development workflows
- **Government context awareness**: Helpful but not required - we provide government-specific background

**New to AI coding assistants?** Start with these resources first:
- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
- [Getting Started with AI Coding Tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)
- [AI-Assisted Programming Best Practices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2023-chatgpt-xu-hao.html)

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Experienced government developers new to AI tools  
**Secondary**: Mixed audience including new developers entering government work and AI-savvy developers new to legacy systems

## Learning Approach

We start with basic AI tool concepts and progress through intermediate scenarios, assuming learners are unfamiliar with AI development tools. Each lesson includes callbacks to foundational concepts as we advance to more sophisticated techniques.

## 10-Lesson Progressive Curriculum

### Foundation Phase (Lessons 1-3)
- **Lesson 1**: AI Tool Fundamentals for Legacy Development (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 2**: Legacy Code Analysis and Documentation (45-60 min)  
- **Lesson 3**: Debugging and Troubleshooting with AI (30-45 min)

### Integration Phase (Lessons 4-6)
- **Lesson 4**: Database Integration and Query Optimization (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 5**: File Processing and Data Transformation (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 6**: API Integration and Legacy System Connectivity (45-60 min)

### Modernization Phase (Lessons 7-10)
- **Lesson 7**: Refactoring and Code Modernization (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 8**: Testing and Quality Assurance in Legacy Environments (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 9**: Compliance and Security in AI-Assisted Development (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 10**: Advanced Integration and Migration Strategies (45-60 min)

## Key Features

- **Tool-Agnostic Principles**: Focus on transferable concepts rather than specific tool features
- **Hands-On Learning**: Active AI tool usage with guided demonstrations
- **Government-Focused**: Authentic scenarios including COBOL, legacy Java, vintage APIs, database systems, and file processing
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from basic concepts to advanced integration scenarios
- **Dual Assessment**: Practical challenges combined with reflective analysis

## Branching Strategy

Each lesson uses a structured branching approach for different learning needs:

- **`lesson-N-start`**: Clean starting point with practice materials and instructions
- **`lesson-N-complete`**: Full implementation with solution examples and worked demonstrations  
- **`lesson-N-variations`**: Alternative approaches and advanced scenarios

### Current Available Branches
- **`main`**: Latest development version with complete materials
- **`lesson-01-start`**: Lesson 1 starting materials (practice code samples and instructions)
- **`lesson-01-complete`**: *(Coming soon)* Lesson 1 with solution examples and worked AI prompting demonstrations

## Getting Started

### For Learners
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/callistorage/SBX_GenAI_GovLegacy_Learning.git`
2. **Choose your starting point**: 
   - New to AI tools? Start with `git checkout lesson-01-start`
   - Want to see examples? Use `git checkout lesson-01-complete` *(when available)*
3. **Follow the lesson materials**: Each lesson includes technology overviews and external learning resources
4. **Use your AI tool**: Practice with your preferred AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
5. **Complete assessments**: Both practical challenges and reflective analysis

### For Instructors
- Use the `instructor-guide.md` in each lesson for teaching strategies and common challenges
- Switch between branches to demonstrate different phases of learning
- Adapt materials for your specific audience and time constraints
