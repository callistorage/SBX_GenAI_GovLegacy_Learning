# Progressive Learning Sandbox: AI Tools for Government Legacy Systems

## Overview

This comprehensive, open-source learning sandbox teaches developers how to effectively use Generative AI coding assistant tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) within government legacy system environments. 

**Why This Matters**: While abundant content exists for modern greenfield development, there's virtually no educational material focused on the unique challenges and constraints of government legacy systems.

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Experienced government developers new to AI tools  
**Secondary**: Mixed audience including new developers entering government work and AI-savvy developers new to legacy systems

## Learning Approach

We start with basic AI tool concepts and progress through intermediate scenarios, assuming learners are unfamiliar with AI development tools. Each lesson includes callbacks to foundational concepts as we advance to more sophisticated techniques.

## 10-Lesson Progressive Curriculum

### Foundation Phase (Lessons 1-3)
- **Lesson 1**: AI Tool Fundamentals for Legacy Development (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 2**: Legacy Code Analysis and Documentation (45-60 min)  
- **Lesson 3**: Debugging and Troubleshooting with AI (30-45 min)

### Integration Phase (Lessons 4-6)
- **Lesson 4**: Database Integration and Query Optimization (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 5**: File Processing and Data Transformation (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 6**: API Integration and Legacy System Connectivity (45-60 min)

### Modernization Phase (Lessons 7-10)
- **Lesson 7**: Refactoring and Code Modernization (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 8**: Testing and Quality Assurance in Legacy Environments (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 9**: Compliance and Security in AI-Assisted Development (45-60 min)
- **Lesson 10**: Advanced Integration and Migration Strategies (45-60 min)

## Key Features

- **Tool-Agnostic Principles**: Focus on transferable concepts rather than specific tool features
- **Hands-On Learning**: Active AI tool usage with guided demonstrations
- **Government-Focused**: Authentic scenarios including COBOL, legacy Java, vintage APIs, database systems, and file processing
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from basic concepts to advanced integration scenarios
- **Dual Assessment**: Practical challenges combined with reflective analysis

## Getting Started

1. Choose your lesson based on your experience level
2. Each lesson includes technology overviews with external learning resources
3. Follow the hands-on exercises using your preferred AI coding assistant
4. Complete both practical challenges and reflective assessments
