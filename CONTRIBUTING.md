# Contributing to Progressive Learning Sandbox: AI Tools for Government Legacy Systems

Welcome! We're building an open-source learning resource that addresses a critical gap in developer education - teaching how to effectively use AI coding assistants within government legacy system environments.

## Project Vision

This sandbox teaches developers how to use Generative AI tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) with government legacy systems including COBOL, legacy Java, vintage APIs, database systems, and file processing. We focus on practical, applicable skills rather than theoretical concepts.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from:
- **Government developers** with legacy system experience
- **Educators** who teach legacy system development
- **AI tool experts** who understand developer workflows
- **Technical writers** who can improve documentation
- **Subject matter experts** in government development processes

## Types of Contributions

- Include all required components: README.md, instructor-guide.md, code-samples/, assessments/
- Ensure 30-60 minute target duration with clear time breakdowns
- Focus on hands-on learning with practical exercises

#### Lesson Enhancement
- Improve existing code samples with more realistic scenarios
- Add advanced variations for experienced learners
