# Lesson 1 Assessment: AI Tool Fundamentals

## Practical Challenge (15 minutes)

### Challenge Overview
Using your AI coding assistant, analyze the government benefit processing system in `challenge-code.cob`. This is a legacy COBOL program that processes food assistance benefit applications.

### Your Tasks

#### Task 1: Generate Comprehensive Documentation (5 minutes)
Use your AI tool to create documentation that includes:
- **Program Purpose**: What does this system do in business terms?
- **Data Flow**: How does data move through the program?
- **Business Rules**: What are the eligibility criteria and calculation rules?
- **File Processing**: How are applicant records processed?

**Suggested AI Prompt**:
```text
Please analyze this COBOL government benefit processing program and create comprehensive documentation:

[INSERT CHALLENGE-CODE.COB CONTENT]

Include:
1. Program purpose and business function
2. Data structures and their meanings
3. Processing workflow step-by-step
4. Business rules for benefit calculation
5. File handling and record processing approach
```

#### Task 2: Identify Three Potential Improvements (5 minutes)
Ask your AI tool to suggest improvements while considering:
- Code maintainability and readability
- Error handling and validation
- Performance in a government batch processing environment
- Documentation and comments

**Suggested AI Prompt**:
```text
Review this government COBOL benefit processing program and suggest three specific improvements:

[CHALLENGE-CODE.COB CONTENT]

Consider:
- Government development standards and maintainability
- Error handling for invalid data
- Performance for processing large files
- Code clarity for future developers
- Backwards compatibility requirements
```

#### Task 3: Safe Implementation Plan (5 minutes)
For one of the improvements identified in Task 2, use your AI tool to:
- Explain how you would safely implement the change
- Identify testing requirements
- Consider impact on existing data and processes
- Address government change control processes

**Suggested AI Prompt**:
```text
For this improvement: [DESCRIBE ONE IMPROVEMENT FROM TASK 2]

Create a safe implementation plan for this government COBOL system:

1. Step-by-step implementation approach
2. Testing strategy and requirements
3. Potential risks and mitigation strategies
4. Backwards compatibility considerations
5. Documentation updates needed
6. Approval processes for government environment
```

#### Task 4: Research Gaps (Immediate)
List three questions you would need to research beyond what the AI tool provided:

Examples might include:
- Government-specific compliance requirements
- Integration with mainframe batch scheduling
- Data security and privacy considerations
- Agency-specific business rules
- Legacy system constraints

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After completing this assessment, check that you can:

- [ ] Configure an AI tool appropriately for government legacy development
- [ ] Write effective prompts that provide necessary context for legacy code analysis
- [ ] Use AI assistance to understand unfamiliar COBOL code and business logic
- [ ] Generate comprehensive documentation with AI tool assistance
- [ ] Identify code improvement opportunities while considering government constraints
- [ ] Recognize when AI tool suggestions need additional human review and validation
- [ ] Apply appropriate caution and best practices in government development environments
- [ ] Understand the limitations of AI tools in government-specific contexts

## Next Steps

**If you feel confident** with most checklist items:
- Proceed to Lesson 2: Legacy Code Analysis and Documentation
- Consider practicing with additional legacy code samples

**If you need more practice**:
- Review the lesson materials and try different prompting strategies
- Practice with the other code samples (cobol-sample.cob, java-sample.java, sql-sample.sql)
- Focus on areas where your confidence is lowest

**For advanced learners**:
- Try analyzing the challenge code without AI assistance first, then compare with AI-generated analysis
- Experiment with different AI tools to understand their varied capabilities
- Research government-specific COBOL patterns and standards to enhance your context knowledge
